This library is strongly inspired by Pirkelbauer, Solodkyy and
Stroustrup's paper [@http://www.stroustrup.com/multimethods.pdf "Open Multi-Methods for C++"].

The paper [@http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/07/37/21/PDF/RR-2977.pdf
"Fast algorithms for compressed multi-method dispatch tables
generation"] by Amiel, Dujardin and Simon was influential in the design
of the algorithm for dispatch table generation.
